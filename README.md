# CodSoft Internship Projects
----------
This repository showcases the machine learning projects completed during my Data Science internship at CodSoft. The projects focus on classification, regression, and handling imbalanced datasets. Each project explores different aspects of data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## Projects
### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
#### Objective: 
The goal of this project was to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

#### Approach:
This project uses the Titanic dataset to train machine learning models to predict survival. Multiple classification models were applied, and their performances were evaluated using various metrics.

#### Techniques Used:
